# Roll-A-Ball: A Unity Game Project

This repository contains a fully-playable 3D level created in Unity. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in level design, lighting, and animation to create a compelling and atmospheric player experience. Every element, from the placement of assets to the color of the lights, was chosen to guide the player and enhance the mood of the environment.

### Gameplay
The objective is to stay way from Mr.Racoon while collect every glowing orb scattered throughout the level. Once the final orb is collected, you've won!
